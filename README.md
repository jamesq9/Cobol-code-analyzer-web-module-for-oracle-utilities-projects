# Cobol Code Analyzer Web Module for Oracle Utilities Projects.

Archiving an old project to Github.

This software can be used for Oracle Utilties Cobol upgrade Projects where it is required to analyze a lot of cobol code as this software aids you in that process by providingp you with a user-friendly UI which helps you to easily understand the process/control flow and dependencies among different files & sections within each program.  


- Place all the cobol code in the CobolCM folder
- Run the COBOL-WEB-MODULE.jar file and follow its instructions 
  - Make sure to analyze the code first and generate assests for each file.

A Collegue of mine helped me in this project, I'm yet to find him on github and give him credit for his work on the Pictorial tree view of the control flows. This is the place holder for that.
